# Clockify Integration Change log

# 21.2.20221208.81533

- added a setting in the `Clockify Setup` to show negative outstanding estimates. This is useful to see if estimates where exeeded. Keep disabled if you do not use estimates in clockify. https://github.com/Stefan-Maron-Consulting/ClockifyIntegrationNews/labels/enhancement
- added Time sheets to be printed from `Sales Invoices` and `Posted Sales Invoices`. Also added a setting in the `Clockify Setup` and `Customer` to enable `Automatic Attach Time Sheets`. If enabled the Time sheet will be attached to a posted invoice automatically. It will also automatically attach the time sheet to the E-Mail if you send the invoice right from Business Central. https://github.com/Stefan-Maron-Consulting/ClockifyIntegrationNews/labels/enhancement
- fixed a bug where not all time entries where loaded from clockify when there where many time entries for one employee https://github.com/Stefan-Maron-Consulting/ClockifyIntegrationNews/labels/bug
